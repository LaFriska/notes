## SML Notes

Here are my notes for ANU's COMPO4670, Statistical Machine Learning. These notes do not contain perfectly precise mathematical rigour, and much of trivial intuitions are omitted. These notes are designed to be compact, and I prioritised convenience of my personal use rather than making it perfectly accessible to everyone.

## Exercise Attempts

I might write out and keep my own mathematical working in case I need again. Hence there are attempts to some exercises from the textbook. Note that they are NOT solutions and may contain errors. 

Out of courtesy for the convenors, I will archive my attempts to the exercises if they happen to reveal the answer to an assignment. However they may still be found through past commit history, and since I did not know in advance that these exercises were used as assignments, I will hold no academic responsibility for these answers.
