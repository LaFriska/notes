## SML Notes

Here are my notes for ANU's COMPO4670, Statistical Machine Learning. These notes do not contain perfectly precise mathematical rigour, and much intuitions and explanations are omitted. I strongly advice against using these notes as your primary source of study, they should be kept as a convenient document to retrieve formulas and general steps of solving machine learning problems. These notes are designed to be compact, and I prioritised convenience of my personal use rather than making it perfectly accessible to everyone.

## Exercise Attempts

I might write out and keep my own mathematical working in case I need again. Hence there are attempts to some exercises from the textbook. Note that they are NOT solutions and may contain errors. 

Out of courtesy for the convenors, I will archive my attempts to the exercises if they happen to reveal the answer to an assignment. However they may still be found through past commit history, and since I did not know in advance that these exercises were used as assignments, I will hold no academic responsibility for these answers.
